**Business Context:**

* In the modern world, owning a vehicle emerges as a common aspiration, providing individuals with a sense of mobility and freedom. Many opt for pre-owned vehicles due to their affordability.
* However, persisting concerns revolve around the quality of after-sales service offered by resale vendors compared to original manufacturers.
* To address this, I, as a data scientist at New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company, have developed an app providing end-to-end service, including listing vehicles and capturing after-sales feedback.

**Problem Statement:**

* Over the past year, New-Wheels has observed a steady decline in sales, attributed to critical customer feedback impacting new customer acquisition.
* As the data scientist, I am tasked with providing quarterly reports with key metrics to assess business health and guide decision-making.

**Objective:**

* My aim as a data scientist is to address leadership queries using available data, providing insights for quarterly business reports.
* I will import and analyze data from the provided dump file to facilitate the creation of visualizations and reports to aid decision-making.

**Data Description:**

* The dataset includes information on vehicles (make, model, year, price), customers (location, payment methods), orders, shipments, and after-sales feedback.
* A data dictionary (new_wheels_sales.txt) and dump file (new_wheels_dumpfile.sql) are provided for reference.

**Solution Approach:**

* I will import the dump file into MySQL for data analysis, address business queries outlined in the project guidelines using SQL queries, utilize query results to generate visualizations in Python/Excel, and create the Quarterly Business Report based on analyzed data and visual insights.
